## Technologies 

### React

This project was created using the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library. To run in development mode, run ```npm start``` in the terminal. This will run the application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

### SASS

To style this application I used the CSS Preprocessor [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/). SASS allows for quicker and more consistent development as you can create CSS variables, nest CSS rules and more.
